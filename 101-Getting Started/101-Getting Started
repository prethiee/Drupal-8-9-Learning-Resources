Drupal 8 is similar to Symfony 2

- Symfony is heart of Drupal 8 core
- Model - Business Logic
- View - Display Logic
- Controller - Glue between model and view

YAML

- easy to use, easy to read
- language neutral format
- *perl *python *ruby *php
- indentation instead of enclosures

Difference between D7 & D8 info files

- all ‘=’ to ‘:'
- {project} : {module} instead of depend[] = node
- symfony YAML → new parser component
- use # instead  ; for comments
- “type” →mandatory
- files[] removed and loaded using PSR-4 compatible class loader in core
